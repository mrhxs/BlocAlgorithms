1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:
A: 
Making coffee
FUNCTION
  IF coffee filter is not in filter basket THEN add coffee filter to basket THEN
    IF coffee ground amount is enough for 2 cups THEN
      WHILE coffee is not finished brewing
        keep brewing
      END WHILE
      PRINT coffee
    END IF
  END IF
END FUNCTION

Washing dishes
FUNCTION
  WHILE sink is not filled up with water
    Increment water
  END WHILE
  ADD soap to sponge
  FOR each dish that's in the sink
    IF dish is dirty
      wash dish
      rinse dish
      dry dish
      put dish up
    ELSE
      rinse dish
      dry dish
      put dish up
    END IF
  END FOR
END FUNCTION

Making a sandwich
FUNCTION
  IF I have 2 slices of bread
    put turkey on slice 1
    put cheese on slice 2
    IF the 2 slices are not empty
      combine 2 slices together
      PRINT sandwich
    END IF
  END IF
END FUNCTION

2. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix
Facebook's algorithm quickly works in the background and decides what to show you on your newfeeds. They're always working
to show the top most relevant information within your networks.
Amazon uses algorithms to display sugestions for shopping based off of past searches and order history. Again they're working
to show customers what they think is relevant to them. 
Netflix uses their technology to give suggestions on what to watch based off of past viewing history and category patterns. 
They're also going to use information around age and demographic to try to keep you on the platform as long as possible. 

3. An efficent algorithm is made by having clear steps throught the entire process. It minimizes errors without affecting the outcome. 
It should be fast and efficient with solid and consistant results. An inefficient algorithm is one that takes extra unnecessary steps.
It may produce inconsistent results and use to many resources while working.
